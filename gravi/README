Discussion on how to use the P2VMREDUCED data

VISDATA * exp(1J.PHASE_REF)  captures the SC and the FT differential measurement

I checked that gdelay(VISDATA) - gdelay(VISDATA_FT) ~ gdelay(VISDATA * exp(1J.PHASE_REF))
This is true to about 100nm.

But how to add the metrology:

The full offset is out of the coherence length (interferometric FOV),
Thus we should store (part of) it in a pur delay column.
But we cannot just store the MET as a pur delay since we have the dispersion

Do we want the dispersion to be followed (changed) during the integration ??

What do we integrate ??

signal = VISDATA * exp(1J.PHASE_REF) * exp(1J.PHASE_MET) * exp(2pi.J.OPD_MET_FC/lbd)

signal = <VISDATA * exp(1J.PHASE_REF)>  *  <OPD_MET_FC>


So we need: a pur delay and a chromatic phase
Or a chromatic delay

Where do we apply or store the dispersion phase ??

Not in PHASE_REF because I would like 
   - we may like that it contains only the FT phase (for checks)

PHASE_MET DELAY_MET


signal =
