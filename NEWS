------------------------------------------
2019/10/30 : New version 1.3.0
------------------------------------------

- Support for the new grisms after Gravity instrument intervention (PIPE-8712)
- Added to the products the residuals of the dispersio model fit (PIPE-8738)
- Include the reduction of 6th pixels of the FT (PIPE-8735)
- Added smoothing of metrology data (PIPE-8472)
- Fix the pupil data for ATs (PIPE-8718)
- Use DISP_MODEL in Reflex workflow (PIPE-7582, PIPE-7728)
- Remove the gravity_image recipe (PIPE-8379)
- Improved support for dual-file on-axis data. Work still in progress (PIPE-8479)
- Support for synchronisation acquisition camera with respect to the metrology values (PIPE-8504)
- Unwrapping of OPD_TELFC around median value (PIPE-8499)
- Calculate the correct PA of the camera On-Axis (PIPE-8491)
- Do not use first pixel in calculation of QC parameters in low resolution in gravity_p2vm recipe (PIPE-7914)
- Apply smoothing of the metrology data (PIPE-8472)
- Fix some problems with GRAVITY products not being DICB complaint (PIPE-6844,PIPE-8366)



------------------------------------------
2019/05/22 : New version 1.2.4
------------------------------------------

- Solved viscal workflow crash with python error.
- Solved several pipeline failres in recipes gravity_wavelamp, gravity_disp, gravity_p2vm.
- Support in gravity_vis and gravity_wkf workflow for DISP_MODEL static calibration.
- Fixed issue in gravity_vis option --static-name=true that overwrote sky files.

------------------------------------------
2018/04/09 : New version 1.1.1
------------------------------------------

- New way to compute the wavelengths of the LOW spectral resolution mode. 
  Now there is an alternative calibration algorithm and an alternative pixel 
  interpolation.
- Astrometry changes (including metrology) towards dueal field observations 
  of the galactic center. In particular the data reduction now takes into 
  account the pupil motion derived from the acquisition camera and the 
  metrology diode measurements.
- Improvements on Strehl ratio computation.

------------------------------------------
New version 1.0
------------------------------------------

2016/06/01 : r181290 : Weight the average of TF by the 1/sigma2, so that TF points with poor 
	quality are discarded.

2015/12/24 : r181259 : Implement the force-calib option in recipe gravi_all_viscal

2015/12/21 : r181201 : The recipe gravi_all_viscal now accept a new option delta-time-calib=XXX [s],
	to choose the smoothing time for the TF interpolation (was 10h, now default is 1h)

------------------------------------------
20115/12/17 : r181063 : New version 0.7.8
------------------------------------------

2015/12/15 : r180965 : Revers the UV plane to follow OIFITS convention.

2015/12/09 - r180729 : in gravi_compute_p2vm : take the GD into acccount to compute
	the coherence of the p2vm. In gravi_array_smooth compute the average instead ot the sum.

2015/12/07 - r180674 : Add the option --debias_sc and --debias_ft in the recipe	gravi_single and
	 gravi_dual to better track if the bias correction was used or not.

-------------------------------------------------
2015/12/03 - r180593 : move to ESO svn repository
-------------------------------------------------
