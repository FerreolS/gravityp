func fmin(f, a, b, lim, tol=, all=, eps=)
/* DOCUMENT fmin(f, a, b)
       -or- fmin(f, a, b, lim)
     Get the location  of the minimum of univariate function  F(X).  F is a
     Yorick  function,  A and  B  are bounds  or  starting  values for  the
     variable X and optional LIM specifies the kind of limits for X:
       If LIM=0 or nil, there is no bounds for X: F is first evaluated at A
         and B, then the interval of  search is enlarged until a minimum is
         bracketed.
       If LIM=1,  the interval is bounded by  A: F is first  evaluated at B
         and  the interval is  enlarged (away  from A)  until a  minimum is
         bracketed  --  i.e.  the location of  the  minimum X is such that:
         A < X, if A < B; or A > X, if A > B.
       If LIM=2, the  interval is bounded by B (same as  with LIM=1 but the
         role of A and B exchanged).
       If LIM=3, the minimum is searched  in the interval (A,B) -- i.e. the
         location of the minimum X is such that: min(A,B) < X < max(A,B).

     Keyword  TOL can be  used to  specify the  relative precision  for the
     solution.  The default value is TOL=sqrt(EPS) (see below).

     If keyword ALL  is true (non-nil and non-zero)  the returned value is:
     [X, FX, XLO, XHI] where X is the approximated location of the minimum,
     FX is F(X) and XLO and XHI are the lower and upper bounds for the true
     minimum; otherwise, only X is returned.

     Keyword EPS  can be  used to specify  the machine  relative precision.
     Default value is EPS~2.22e-16,  which corresponds to IEEE standard for
     double precision.

   NOTES:
     (1) The  minimization routine  should never evaluates  F at  the given
         bounds if any.
     (2) If the function F(X) is  not unimodal, only a local minimum can be
         found.

   REFERENCES:
     The method is  based on original Brent's method  modified to allow for
     different kind of bounds (both, left, right or none).
